# Image-To-Planet-SFS
 Various python scripts that are able to generate heightmaps (and fixed textures to fit said heightmaps) from input images for the game Spaceflight Simulator.
 
 Current scripts:
 - ImageToTerrain.py - Converts an input image to a texture heightmap, and provides the correct terrain formula for the output heightmap. (May create a new heightmap generator later on that creates a text-based output instead.)
 - Image2Terrain.py (Very intuitive nomenclature) - Deforms the input image so that it is displayed correctly in-game.
 - TerrainImageFixer.py - A **WIP** rewrite of Image2Terrain.py that fixes its various issues.
